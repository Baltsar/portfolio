# Cursor AI Agent - Setup Instructions

## 📦 Files Included

```
.cursor/rules/   OR   project root/
  ├── core.mdc                    # Main AI instructions
  ├── typescript.mdc              # TypeScript rules
  ├── react.mdc                   # React patterns
  ├── shadcn.mdc                  # ShadCN UI rules
  ├── testing.mdc                 # Auto-testing
  ├── git.mdc                     # Git workflow
  ├── anti-hallucination.mdc      # Prevent AI mistakes
  └── workflow.mdc                # Task management

AGENTS.md                         # Project context (project root)
LIVE WORKBENCH PORTFOLIO.md       # Source of truth for LIVE workbench (project root)
.cursorignore                     # Files to ignore (optional)
```

**Rule placement:** Cursor can load `.mdc` rules from either `.cursor/rules/` or the project root. Use one or the other so docs and setup match.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Copy Files to Your Project

**Option A – in .cursor/rules (recommended for shared setups):**
```bash
# In your Next.js project root:
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
```

Copy all `.mdc` files to `.cursor/rules/`  
Copy `AGENTS.md` and `LIVE WORKBENCH PORTFOLIO.md` to project root  
Copy `.cursorignore` to project root if you use it

**Option B – in project root:**  
Keep `.mdc` files in the project root (as in this repo). Copy `AGENTS.md` and `LIVE WORKBENCH PORTFOLIO.md` there too.

### 2. Folder Structure

Your project should look like (rules in `.cursor/rules/` or in root):

```
my-project/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/           # optional: put .mdc here
│       ├── core.mdc
│       └── ...
├── AGENTS.md
├── LIVE WORKBENCH PORTFOLIO.md   # for LIVE workbench builds
├── core.mdc              # or: keep .mdc in root
├── ...
├── app/
├── components/
├── package.json
└── ...
```

### 3. Verify Setup

Open Cursor AI and check:
- Settings → Rules → You should see all 8 rules listed
- The rules should show as "Always Apply" (core, testing, git, anti-hallucination)

## 💬 How to Use

### Example 1: Simple Feature

**You:**
```
Add a hero section with heading and CTA button
```

**AI:**
```
I'll add a hero section with heading and CTA.

Plan:
1. Create hero component
2. Add to homepage
3. Style with Tailwind

Proceed?
```

**You:** `yes`

**AI:** [builds, tests, commits automatically]

### Example 2: Complex Feature

**You:**
```
Build a blog with posts, categories, and search
```

**AI:**
```
This is complex. I'll create a plan.

[Creates detailed task breakdown]

Proceed?
```

**You:** `yes`

**AI:** [builds autonomously, shows progress, asks to push when done]

## ✅ What AI Does Automatically

- ✅ Builds complete features
- ✅ Runs tests (type-check, lint, build)
- ✅ Fixes its own errors
- ✅ Commits with proper messages
- ✅ Never shows you code (unless you ask)

## 🎯 Your Role

1. Describe what you want (plain English)
2. Approve the plan ("yes")
3. Approve push to production ("yes")

That's it!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### AI Will Ask Permission Only Twice:

1. **Before building:** "Should I proceed?"
2. **Before pushing:** "Push to production?"

### AI Will NOT:

- ❌ Show you code (unless you ask)
- ❌ Ask you to fix errors
- ❌ Ask mid-implementation questions
- ❌ Invent packages or APIs

### If AI Shows Code:

Say: **"Don't show code. Build it and test it autonomously."**

### If AI Asks You to Fix Errors:

Say: **"You fix all errors autonomously."**

## 📋 Common Commands

```
"Add [feature]"
"Fix [bug]"
"Make [X] look better"
"Build [page/component]"
"Change [X] to [Y]"
"Update [element]"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Rules Not Loading?

1. Check files are in `.cursor/rules/` or in project root (whichever you use)
2. Restart Cursor
3. Open Settings → Rules → Verify they appear

### AI Still Showing Code?

Remind it:
```
Follow your core.mdc rules. Don't show code. Build autonomously.
```

### AI Not Testing?

Remind it:
```
You must run type-check, lint, and build before EVERY commit.
Fix errors yourself.
```

## 🎓 Tips

1. **Be specific:** Instead of "make it nice", say "add gradient background and rounded corners"

2. **Complex features:** Let AI create the plan first, then approve

3. **Trust the process:** AI will test and fix errors autonomously

4. **Review results, not code:** Check the live result, not the implementation
